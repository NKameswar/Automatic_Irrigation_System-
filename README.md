# Automatic_Irrigation_System-
Project On IOT

Automatic irrigation is the use of a device to operate irrigation structures so the change of flow of water from bays can occur in the absence of the irrigator.

Automation can be used in a number of ways:
To start and stop irrigation through supply channel outlet.To start and stop pump.To cut off the flow of water from one irrigation area —  either a bay or a section of channel and directing the water to another area.

The apparatus used in the project are arduino,pump,relay,moisture sensor and some jumper wires.

The main motto of the project is to reduce water usage, reduced labour,timely irrigation,— plants being watered when needed,management of higher flow rates,accurate cut-off of water compared to manual checking,reduced runoff of water and nutrients,reduced costs for vehicles used to check irrigation.
When the sensor doesnot detect water the motor Swicthes on if it detect water then the motor gets turned off.
